# frankfurt-diashow

This project is intended to provide the user with some beautiful pictures of Frankfurt am Main, my hometown.
I used plain JS/HTML and SCSS. The images as well as the info to the pictures are fetched via the Unsplash API.

The inspiration to do this sort of project came from https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/tree/master/Projects/1-Beginner.
